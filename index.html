    <p>
        My main interest is in understanding how the mind works:
        How is it that we're able to learn, think, and act intelligently,
        continually improve our understanding of the world,
        and create things that have never existed before?
    </p>

    <p>
        Following the principle of "what I cannot create, I do not understand",
        I approach this question from the perspective of Artifical Intelligence. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Specifically, I'm less interested in 
        AIs that are tools to be used by people,
        such as the ones that currently exist,
        but rather in the prospect of AIs who are themselves people:
        individuals who live as our equals in society.
