    <h2>scifi</h2>

    <p>
        I have very picky tastes when it comes to scifi:
        I think scifi should depict people tackling new and better problems,
        not just our current problems dressed up in a futuristic setting.
    </p>

    <p>
        And that stories should have a consistent level of progress across 
        both technological and moral areas
        (e.g. I do not want to read about a civilization that is capable of
        interstellar travel, and yet still faces war, aging, material scarcity,
        or a hierarchical social structure).

            <strong>2001</strong> is alright; I just take issue with the fact that 
            HAL is treated as a tool rather than a person.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Rendevous with Rama</strong>: Nice self-contained adventure.
        </li>

            (even though the author <a href="https://twitter.com/Devon_Eriksen_/status/1728839120825520471">tries to claim otherwise</a>).
