    <h2>scifi</h2>

    <p>
        I have very picky tastes when it comes to scifi.
        I think scifi should depict people tackling new and better problems,
        not just our current problems dressed up in a futuristic setting.
    </p>

    <p>
        And that stories should have a consistent level of progress across 
        both technological and moral areas. (e.g. I do not want to read about a civilization that is capable of
        interstellar travel, and yet still faces war, material scarcity,
        or a hierarchical social structure.)

    <h3>ones that hit the spot:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Greg Egan: <strong>Diaspora</strong>, <strong>Schild's Ladder</strong></li>
        <li>Andy Weir: <strong>The Martian</strong>, <strong>Project Hail Mary</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>other:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>2001</strong> is alright; I just take issue with the fact that 
            HAL is treated as a tool rather than a person.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Rendevous with Rama</strong>: Nice self-contained adventure.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>grievances:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Three Body Problem</strong>: Interstellar war.</li>
        <li><strong>Dragon's Egg</strong>: Highly advanced civilization decides to withold technology from humans.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Theft of Fire</strong>: Many interesting elements, but ultimately highly distopian
            (even though the author <a href="https://twitter.com/Devon_Eriksen_/status/1728839120825520471">tries to claim otherwise</a>).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Star Trek</strong>: Military structure, Prime Directive.
        </li>
    </ul>
